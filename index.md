# Overview

## About PrepHQ

[PrepHQ's](https://www.theprephq.com/) mission is to provide high-quality and affordable test prep to students all over the country. We offer 20-hour weekend camps that go over everything a student needs to know to get into college, starting from acing the ACT or SAT, and then ending with how to craft the perfect application to get into the school of their dreams.

## About The App

PrepHQ Connect is a digital platform that connects college students to high school students in a near-peer mentorship relationship to provide the inspiration students need to make the most of their education. This platform will democratize the knowledge, preparation, and motivation normally reserved for students from high income families who can afford to pay for expensive services. But we believe test prep and college counseling are things that all students deserve to have access to. With that being said, this platform will help students plan out their educational goals in high school and beyond, and help them to make their dreams a reality.
